GitHub API Test

## Run test with `mvn clean test`

#### Assumptions & Approach

As an Engineer I take this project development in Agile Method where we plan our sprint with 
scrum master and PO. Also I will take Behaviour Driven Development as the product development approach as this involves each stake holder to build user stories
and test scenarios. This way I can get clear idea of the product and there by I can develop BDD based test cases which are easily understood by anyone.
